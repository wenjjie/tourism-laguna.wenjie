          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>The province of Laguna, located in the Philippines, has a rich history dating back to pre-colonial times. The area was originally settled by the Tagalog people, and was later conquered by the Spanish in the 16th century. During the Spanish colonial period, the province played an important role in the country's economic development, particularly in the production of sugarcane and rice.</p>

                <p class="fst-italic">The presence of human settlements in the area can be traced back to prehistoric times, as seen in the names of towns such as Pila and Laguna.</p>

                <p>The names of these towns are linked to the straight mounds of dirt that form the boundaries of rice paddies. The written history of the province of Laguna, which is known as "Lagoon" in Spanish, and that of the Southern Tagalog region, dates back to 900 AD. The oldest known written document found in the Philippines is the Laguna Copperplate Inscription, which mentions that its subject was freed from a debt to the King of Tondo.</p>
                <p>During the time of pre-Hispanic contact, Gat Pangil was a powerful native ruler in the area, and the towns of Bay, Pangil and Pakil were believed to have been part of his domain, although there are different versions about his identity.</p>

                <p class="fst-italic">The Province of Laguna, which was previously known as La Laguna and La Provincia de la Laguna de Bay, takes its name from the Laguna de Bay, a body of water that forms its northern boundary. </p>
                <p>Laguna de Bay, in turn, was named after the town of Bay, which was the first provincial capital. In 1571, Captain Juan de Salcedo and a group of 100 Spanish-Mexican soldiers conquered the province and surrounding areas for Spain. The original province of La Laguna included the current province of Laguna, as well as parts of present-day Rizal and Quezon provinces.</p>
                <p>In 1577, Spanish Franciscan missionaries arrived in Manila and began spreading Christianity to Laguna, Morong (now Rizal), Tayabas (now Quezon) and the Bicol Peninsula as part of the colonization effort. Juan de Plasencia and Diego de Oropesa were among the first Franciscans sent to these places. From 1580, the towns of Bay, Caliraya, Majayjay, Nagcarlan, Liliw, Pila, Santa Cruz, Lumban, Pangil, and Siniloan were established. During the tenure of Governor-General Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas, the province of La Laguna was divided. By 1591, there were approximately 48,400 people living in the province.</p>

                <p class="fst-italic">The area of Laguna was the location of several battles during the Sangley Rebellion, a rebellion led by Chinese-Filipino mestizos. In 1603, Captain Don Luys de Velasco, with the help of Spanish and Filipino forces, attempted to put down the rebellion but was ultimately killed along with ten of his men. </p>
                <p>The Chinese rebels then retreated to the mountains of San Pablo and waited for reinforcements from the mainland. Eventually, Governor-General Pedro Bravo de Acuña sent Captain Cristoval de Axqueta Menchaca to defeat the rebellion, which was successful after twenty days of fighting. At this time, the hot springs in Los Baños and San Pablo were known to the Spanish and a hospital was built in the area. By 1622, the hospital was significant enough to be mentioned by the Archbishop of Manila in a letter to King Philip IV. In 1639, another rebellion led by the Chinese occurred and the rebels fortified themselves in the highlands of Cavinti and Lumban before surrendering in Pagsanjan a year later.</p>

                <p class="fst-italic">In 1840, a revolt led by Hermano Pule in Lucban, Tayabas sparked religious intolerance and led people from the towns of Majayjay, Nagcarlan, Bay, and Biñan to join.</p>

                <p>The revolt was eventually put down by Governor-General Marcelino de Oraá Lecumberri. During the 19th century, municipalities such as Morong, Pililla, Tanay, Baras, Binangonan, Jalajala, Angono, and Cardona were separated from Laguna and reorganized into the province of Politico-Militar Distrito de Morong. </p>

                <p>In 1861, José Rizal was born in Calamba, who went on to become a leading member of the Propaganda Movement advocating for political reforms. Rizal's novels Noli Me Tángere and El Filibusterismo further fueled anti-colonial sentiment leading to the Philippine Revolution. Laguna was one of the eight provinces that rose in revolt against Spanish rule and had a significant presence in the Katipunan. Rizal was executed in 1896, and today is recognized as a national hero of the Philippines. In 1898, Laguna actively supported the First Philippine Republic proclaimed at Malolos.</p>

                <p>At the start of the Philippine-American War, Generals Juan Cailles and Paciano Rizal were in charge of defending Laguna during the initial stages of the conflict. The Battle of Mabitac was fought to protect the town of Mabitac and was won by Filipino forces. However, troops led by Henry W. Lawton were victorious in Santa Cruz, Pagsanjan, and Paete, ultimately giving control of the province to American forces. Despite this, resistance continued to occur during this time period. One notable figure during these engagements was Teodoro Asedillo, who was considered a bandit by American forces and was a folk hero to the people of the province.</p>

                <p>At the end of the war, the Philippines was occupied by American forces and became a colony. The Taft Commission was put in place to govern the country during the transition period, and Juan Cailles was appointed as the governor of Laguna. Act No. 83 established a civilian government under American rule. During this time, infrastructure improvements were made, such as the construction of roads and the establishment of schools. In 1917, the Manila Railroad Company expanded its line to reach Laguna, specifically Pagsanjan. In 1903, the town of Muntinlupa was added to La Laguna and annexed to the town of Biñan, but it was later returned to the province of Rizal in 1905.</p>

      <h3><b style="color:#6082B6"><br> World War II </b></h3>
      <p>During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines (1942-1945), Laguna was a center of Filipino resistance despite the presence of Makapili collaborators. Marking's Guerrillas attempted to free 115 American POWs in the Cine Lumban in Laguna in June 1942, but only rescued one American. The Japanese executed 10 American prisoners in retaliation. The Philippine Commonwealth Army and the Philippine Constabulary established military bases in Laguna from 1942 to 1946 and engaged in Anti-Japanese Military Operations in Southern Luzon, Mindoro and Palawan. Attacks by Filipino soldiers and recognized guerrillas against Japanese forces in Laguna increased in 1945 in anticipation of the Liberation of the Philippines by joint Filipino and American forces.</p>
      
      <h3><b style="color:#6082B6"><br> Recent History </b></h3>
      <p style="align-items:center">In 1960, during the presidency of Carlos P. Garcia, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) was established with its headquarters located in Los Baños. Under the presidency of Diosdado Macapagal in 1962, IRRI began researching the development of a new high yield “Miracle Rice” (IR8) variety that was enhanced by the use of chemical fertilizers. IR8 served as the foundation for the brief success of the Philippine Government's Masagana 99 agricultural program in the 1970s. However, the program failed in the 1980s due to the ineffectiveness of the Marcos administration's credit scheme. The social unrest caused by Ferdinand Marcos' debt-driven campaign spending led to the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis which sparked protests by students, particularly at UP Los Baños. When martial law was declared in 1972, Marcos suppressed any form of criticism or activism which led to the arrest and torture of many citizens of Laguna. Among those arrested were Dr. Aloysius Baes and those who became missing were Tish Ladlad, Cristina Catalla, Gerardo "Gerry" Faustino, Rizalina Ilagan, Ramon Jasul, Professor Jessica Sales, and Philippine Council for Agricultural Research and Resource Development artist-illustrator Manuel Ontong. Some were confirmed to have been martyred for their beliefs, such as Modesto "Bong" Sison and Manuel Bautista. Camp Vicente Lim in the Canlubang district of Calamba was one of the many sites where prisoners were held who dared to criticize the Marcos administration.</p>
      <p> The cancellation of the Parañaque spillway project in 1977 has led to recurrent flooding along the south and eastern coasts of Laguna de Bay. The spillway was intended to be a part of a plan to reduce flooding in the lakeshore towns of Metro Manila in the 1970s, but financial crises of the 1970s caused a lack of budget and only the Manggahan Floodway in Rizal Province was built. The Floodway diverted water away from the Metro Manila lakeshore towns, but caused it to accumulate in Laguna de Bay. The cancellation of the Parañaque spillway meant that there was no way to reduce the water levels of the lake. In the first year of Manggahan Floodway's completion in 1986, Laguna was hit by an unusual large flood which lasted for 2 months resulting in high mortality and morbidity rates due to water-borne diseases such as gastroenteritis. </p>
